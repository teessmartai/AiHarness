# AGENTS.md

> This file provides context and guidelines for AI agents working on this codebase.
> **AI agents should update this file** as the project evolves.

## Project Overview

<!--
AI: Replace this section with a concise description of what this project does.
If this is a new project, describe the intended purpose and goals.
-->

**Status**: New project / Active development / Maintenance mode
**Primary Language**: Not yet determined
**Framework(s)**: None yet

## Quick Start

```bash
# Setup (update these commands as the project develops)
# npm install / pip install -r requirements.txt / cargo build / etc.

# Run
# npm start / python main.py / cargo run / etc.

# Test
# npm test / pytest / cargo test / etc.

# Lint/Format
# npm run lint / ruff check . / cargo fmt / etc.
```

## Project Structure

<!--
AI: Update this section as files and directories are created.
Keep it current - this is one of the most valuable sections for orientation.
-->

```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

<!-- AI: Document the code style as patterns emerge or are decided -->

- Follow language-specific conventions (PEP 8, StandardJS, rustfmt, etc.)
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Keep functions small and focused
- Write self-documenting code; add comments only for "why", not "what"

### Architecture Decisions

<!--
AI: Document significant architectural decisions here using this format.
This section is critical for maintaining consistency across sessions.
-->

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| (none yet) | | |

### Patterns to Follow

<!-- AI: Add patterns that should be replicated throughout the codebase -->

- (Document patterns as they emerge)

### Patterns to Avoid

<!-- AI: Add anti-patterns discovered or decided against -->

- Avoid over-engineering; implement what's needed now
- Don't add dependencies without clear justification

## Testing Strategy

<!-- AI: Update as testing infrastructure is established -->

**Test Framework**: Not yet selected
**Coverage Target**: (Recommended: 80% for critical paths)

```bash
# Run all tests
# (command here)

# Run specific test
# (command here)
```

## Common Tasks

<!-- AI: Add frequently performed tasks with exact commands -->

### Adding a New Feature
1. (Document the workflow as it develops)

### Fixing a Bug
1. (Document the workflow as it develops)

### Deploying
1. (Document when deployment is set up)

## Environment & Configuration

<!-- AI: Document environment variables, config files, and setup requirements -->

| Variable | Purpose | Required | Default |
|----------|---------|----------|---------|
| (none yet) | | | |

## Dependencies

<!-- AI: Note key dependencies and why they were chosen -->

### Runtime Dependencies
- (none yet)

### Development Dependencies
- (none yet)

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

<!-- AI: Track known issues, workarounds, and planned improvements -->

- (none yet)

## Integration Points

<!-- AI: Document APIs, databases, external services, etc. -->

- (none yet)

## Meta: Maintaining This File

**AI agents working on this codebase should:**

1. **Read this file first** when starting work on the project
2. **Update this file** when:
   - Adding new directories or significant files → Update Project Structure
   - Making architectural decisions → Add to Architecture Decisions
   - Establishing patterns → Document in Patterns to Follow
   - Adding dependencies → Document in Dependencies with rationale
   - Adding environment variables → Update Environment & Configuration
   - Creating new workflows → Add to Common Tasks
3. **Keep commands current** - If build/test/run commands change, update Quick Start
4. **Remove outdated information** - Don't let this file become stale

### For New/Empty Projects

If you're the first agent working on this project:
1. Clarify the project's purpose with the user
2. Propose a technology stack appropriate for the goals
3. Set up the basic project structure
4. Update this file with initial decisions
5. Establish testing from the start

### For Existing Projects

If this file was just added to an existing project:
1. Explore the codebase structure
2. Identify the tech stack, frameworks, and patterns in use
3. Find and document build/test/run commands
4. Update all sections based on what exists
5. Note any inconsistencies or technical debt discovered
